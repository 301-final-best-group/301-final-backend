  - Slack, remo
- How often will you take breaks?
  - As often as we need (police yourself)
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Bring it up in the daily standup, ask for help (as individuals). As a group, elevate and ask a TA or Roger for advice (if we can't figure out solutions - 15 minute rule).

#### Cooperative

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - Team stand up at the beginning of every class
    - What everyone is working on
    - Expected completion
    - Help needed/blockers
  - Break off into different tables to perform daily work depending on pair programming/individual assignments
  - Retrospective to make sure each person is on the same page about features/knowledge of code base
  - Mob coding, using the driver and navigator method.

#### Conflict Resolution

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - During stand up have a level-setting check-in for any problems that we want to discuss.
  - Call in Roger for any conflict that isn't deescalating.
- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - It is the responsibility of each person to communicate when they've taken on more than they can handle, or to ask for help, and it is the responsibility of each person who notices this behavior to bring it up graciously (without accusation).
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - See conflict resolution plan
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Give each other grace and consider it an opportunity to solidify your learning by helping someone else learn a concept or feature.
  - Rely on each other with retrospectives
